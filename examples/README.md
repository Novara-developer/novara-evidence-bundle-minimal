# Examples

This directory contains example Novara Evidence Bundles for v0.1.

Currently included:

- `hinata-2025-11-19.zip` – demo bundle generated by `scripts/generate_demo_bundle.py`.
  - `meta.json` – basic metadata (who / when / system)
  - `aal.ndjson` – AI Action Log (timeline of events)
  - `attachments/` – prompts, config, notes
  - `anchors/` – reserved for CTK-2 / blockchain / TEE anchors (not used in v0.1)

All bundles in this directory are **demo-only** and not real incident data.
